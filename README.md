# myQuizApp-ios

Developed a quiz app for iOS using SwiftUI that allows users to practice solving math problems. The app features a Play button that generates two random numbers to create a new addition problem each time it is tapped. Implemented a computed property to calculate the solution and display it when the Solve button is tapped. Includes a counter utilizing state management to track the total number of questions attempted. The simple yet educational app provides an easy way for children to sharpen their math skills.
